# Wealth

## Building Wealth

- Making money is not a thing you do - it's a skill you learn.

### Understand How Wealth Is Created

- Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep.

- Society will pay you for creating things it wants. But society doesn’t yet know how to create those things, because if it did, they wouldn’t need you.

- Almost everything in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time.

### Find And Build Specific Knowledge

- Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned.

- When I talk about specific knowledge, I mean figure out what you were doing as a kid or teenager almost effortlessly. Something you didn't even consider a skill, but people around you noticed.

- Basically, when you're competing with people, it's because you're copying them. It's because you're trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don't copy.

- If you are fundamentally building and marketing something that is an extension of who you are, no one can complete with you on that.

- The most important skills for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn.

- If you go to the library and there's a book you cannot understand, you have to dig down and say, "what is the foundation required for me to learn this?" Foundations are super important.

- Basic arithmetic and numeracy are way more important in life than doing calculus. Similarly, being able to convey yourself simply using ordinary English words is far more important than being able to write poetry, having an extensive vocabulary, or speaking seven different foreign languages.

### Play Long-Term Games With Long-Term People

- Compound interest applies to more than just compounding capital. Compounding capital is just the beginning.

- Look at some of the top roles in society, like why someone is a CEO of a public company or managing billions of dollars. It's because people trust them. They are trusted because the relationships they've built and the work they've done has compounded.

- Compound interest also happens in your reputation. If you have a sterling reputation and you keep building it for decades upon decades, people will notice.

- All the normal negotiations in business relationships can work very simply because you trust each other - you know it will work out.

- If there's some cost to pay, he will pay it out of his own pocket, and he won't even mention it to me.

- Intentions don't matter. Actions do. That's why being ethical is hard.

- 99% of effort is wasted.

- I'm not saying don't do the 99 percent, because it's very hard to identify what the 1 percent is. What I'm saying is: when you find the 1 percent of your discipline which will not be wasted, which you'll be able to invest in for the rest of your life and has meaning to you - go all-in and forget about the rest.

### Take On Accountability

- Embrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity and leverage.

### Build Or Buy Equity In A Business

- If you don't own apiece of a business, you don't have a path towards financial freedom.

### Find A Position Of Leverage

- Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is abetter foundation for a career than following whatever is making money right now.

- I only really want to do things for their own sake.

- The year I generated the most wealth for myself was actually the year I worked the least hard and cared the least about the future. I was mostly doing things for the sheer fun of it. I was basically telling people, "I'm retired, I'm not working."Then, I had the time for whatever was my highest valued project in front of me.

- You're more likely to have skills society does not yet know how to train other people to do. If someone can train other people how to do something, then they can replace you. If they can replace you, then they don't have to pay you a lot.

- If they can train you to do it, then eventually they will train a computer to do it.

- Think about what product or service society wants but does not yet know how to get. You want to become the person who delivers it and delivers it at scale. That is really the challenge of how to make money.

- Managing other people is incredibly messy. It requires tremendous leadership skills.

- You're never going to get rich renting out your time.

- Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you're accountability on your output, as opposed to your input - that's the dream.

- For example, a good software engineer, just by writing the right little piece of code and creating the right little application, can literally create half a billion dollars' worth of value for a company. But ten engineers working ten times as hard, just because they choose the wrong model, the wrong product, wrote it the wrong way, or put in the wrong viral loop, have basically wasted their time. Inputs don't match outputs, especially for leveraged workers.

- What you want in life is to be in control of your time. You want to get into a leveraged job where you control your own time and you're tracked on the outputs.

- When you do just the actual work itself, you'll be far more productive, far more efficient. You'll work when you feel like it - when you're high-energy - and you won't be trying to struggle through when you're low energy. You'll gain your time back.

- Forty hour work weeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes - train and sprint, then rest and reassess.

- Tools and leverage create this disconnection between inputs and outputs. The higher the creativity component of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs. If you're looking at professions where your inputs and your outputs are highly connected, it's going to be very hard to create wealth and make wealth for yourself in that process.

- Learn to sell, learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

- Earn with you mind, not your time.
