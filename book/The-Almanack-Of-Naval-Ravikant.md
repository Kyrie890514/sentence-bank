# Wealth

## Building Wealth

- Making money is not a thing you do-it's a skill you learn.

### Understand How Wealth Is Created

- Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it.

> How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky):

> Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.

> Understand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.

> Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.

> You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity-a piece of a business-to gain your financial freedom.

> You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.

> Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.

> The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.

> Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

> Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.

> Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.

> Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

> Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.

> Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.

> Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.

> Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.

> When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.

> Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.

> Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.

> "Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth."
>
> -Archimedes

> Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).

> Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge with accountability and show resulting good judgment.

> Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.

> Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.

> Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.

> An army of robots is freely available-it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.

> If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.

> Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.

> Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.

> There is no skill called "business." Avoid business magazines and business classes.

> Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.

> Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.

> You should be too busy to "do coffee" while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.

> Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.

> Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.

> Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.

> There are no get-rich-quick schemes. Those are just someone else getting rich off you.

> Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.

> When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place. But that is for another day.

> Summary: Productize Yourself

### Find and Build Specific Knowledge

- Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned.

- When I talk about specific knowledge, I mean figure out what you were doing as a kid or teenager almost effortlessly. Something you didn't even consider a skill, but people around you noticed.

- Basically, when you're competing with people, it's because you're copying them. It's because you're trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don't copy.

- If you are fundamentally building and marketing something that is an extension of who you are, no one can complete with you on that.

- The most important skills for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn anything you want to learn.

- Basic arithmetic and numeracy are way more important in life than doing calculus. Similarly, being able to convey yourself simply using ordinary English words is far more important than being able to write poetry, having an extensive vocabulary, or speaking seven different foreign languages.

### Play Long-Term Games with Long-Term People

- All the normal negotiations in business relationships can work very simply because you trust each other-you know it will work out.

- If there's some cost to pay, he will pay it out of his own pocket, and he won't even mention it to me.

- Intentions don't matter. Actions do. That's why being ethical is hard.

- 99% of effort is wasted.

- I'm not saying don't do the 99 percent, because it's very hard to identify what the 1 percent is. What I'm saying is: when you find the 1 percent of your discipline which will not be wasted, which you'll be able to invest in for the rest of your life and has meaning to you-go all-in and forget about the rest.

### Take on Accountability

### Build or Buy Equity In A Business

### Find a Position Of Leverage

- Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a career than following whatever is making money right now.

- I only really want to do things for their own sake.

- You're more likely to have skills society does not yet know how to train other people to do. If someone can train other people how to do something, then they can replace you. If they can replace you, then they don't have to pay you a lot.

- If they can train you to do it, then eventually they will train a computer to do it.

- Think about what product or service society wants but does not yet know how to get. You want to become the person who delivers it and delivers it at scale. That is really the challenge of how to make money.

- Managing other people is incredibly messy. It requires tremendous leadership skills.

- You're never going to get rich renting out your time.

- Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you're accountability on your output, as opposed to your input - that's the dream.

- For example, a good software engineer, just by writing the right little piece of code and creating the right little application, can literally create half a billion dollars' worth of value for a company. But ten engineers working ten times as hard, just because they choose the wrong model, the wrong product, wrote it the wrong way, or put in the wrong viral loop, have basically wasted their time. Inputs don't match outputs, especially for leveraged workers.

- What you want in life is to be in control of your time. You want to get into a leveraged job where you control your own time and you're tracked on the outputs.

- When you do just the actual work itself, you'll be far more productive, far more efficient. You'll work when you feel like it - when you're high-energy - and you won't be trying to struggle through when you're low energy. You'll gain your time back.

- Forty hour work weeks are a relic of the Industrial Age. Knowledge workers function like athletes - train and sprint, then rest and reassess.

- Tools and leverage create this disconnection between inputs and outputs. The higher the creativity component of a profession, the more likely it is to have disconnected inputs and outputs. If you're looking at professions where your inputs and your outputs are highly connected, it's going to be very hard to create wealth and make wealth for yourself in that process.

- Learn to sell, learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

- Earn with you mind, not your time.
